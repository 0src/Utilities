This bash script is a convenience wrapper for developers/testers to be
able to quickly plot and mine under various IDs under the DEV or
STAGING TestNets.

You can either solo-mine or pool-mine (in which case you have to set
the reward recipient manually).

Ids are generated from random input, but are stored with that random
input for access to these accounts.

Unix-only (bash, cg_obup, mdcct)
